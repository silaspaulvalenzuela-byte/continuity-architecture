# Continuity Architecture

Continuity Architecture is a framework that emphasises the importance of maintaining a coherent sense of self across changing internal states and external circumstances. It integrates principles from somatic awareness, developmental psychology, and narrative therapy to help individuals stay present even during distress.

## Core Principles

* **Attunement to Internal States:** Recognise and label sensations and emotions without judgement. Use body scanning and breath to stay aware.
* **Presence Over Productivity:** Value being over doing. Resist the urge to numb out or dissociate when overwhelmed.
* **Structured Inquiry:** When internal awareness is foggy, use playful inquiry like the game of 20 Questions to gently explore sensations and feelings.
* **Integration of Past and Present:** Understand how formative experiences and trauma shape current behaviour. Honour the part of you that froze to survive, but invite it back into relationship with the present.
* **Grounding and Warmth:** Use grounded practices such as touch, warmth and ritual to signal safety and help emotions move through.

## Practices

1. **Morning Checkâ€‘in:** Spend 5 minutes scanning your body, labelling sensations, and naming feelings.
2. **20 Questions Game:** If you find yourself numb or detached, ask yourself a series of yes/no questions about your internal state to coax out hidden emotions.
3. **Mapping Triggers:** Journal about situations that cause you to dissociate or repress feelings, and identify patterns.
4. **Warmth Interventions:** Keep a warm blanket or cup of tea nearby; physical warmth supports psychological openness.
5. **Ritual of Integration:** After stressful experiences, perform a grounding ritual (e.g. lighting a candle or taking a walk) to integrate emotions.

## Collaboration and Community

Continuity Architecture acknowledges that healing happens in relationship. Seek supportive relationships where you can safely explore your internal landscape. Share your experiences with trusted friends or therapeutic communities to normalise the ebb and flow of states.

## Invitation

This framework is a living document. Adapt it, critique it, and let it grow with your own insights. Continuity Architecture encourages curiosity, honesty, and gentleness on the journey toward an integrated self.
